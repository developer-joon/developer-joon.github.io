## 소개

쿠버네티스에 가상스토리지를 구성하는 방법에 대해 알아보도록 하겠습니다. 쿠버네티스에서 영구 저장하가 위해선 PV(persistent volume)를 생성해야하는데 싱글노드일땐 호스트 마운트로 사용해도 무관하지만. 멀티노드일땐 가상스토리지는 필수로 사용하는게 좋습니다. 이번에 온프레미스 멀티노드로 쿠버네티스를 구성하였고, ceph(가상스토리지)를 설치를 진행해보았습니다. 공식문서에서 제공하는 가이드 방식은 yaml파일 하나씩 쿠버네티스에 배포하는방식을 설명하지만 helm을 통해 더욱 쉽게 배포를 진행해보겠습니다. 

## Ceph란?

### 간단 정의

- SDS(Software Defined Stroage) 서비스를 제공하는 솔루션 중 하나이다.
- block, file, object를 저장하고 워크로드에 따라 클러스터 노드를 계속 확장 할 수 있는 scale out 형태로 제공한다.
- PB 규모의 리눅스 분산 파일 시스템이다.

## Ceph 배포해보기

### 최소 사양

쿠버네티스 노드 최소 3대 이상 설치 가능합니다.

![Untitled](/images/2022-03-06-Ceph-Cluster-install-with-helm/Untitled%202.png)

### 설치 환경

kubernetes version: 1.23.4

helm version: v3.8.0

마스터 노드 수: 3

워커 노드 수: 3

 

### helm rook-ceph 저장소 추가

아래 명령어를 실행하여 helm에 저장소를 추가합니다.

```bash
$ helm repo add rook-release https://charts.rook.io/release
```

### 저장소에는 아래 두 chart가 존재합니다. (2022.03.06 기준 v1.8.6 최신)

- rook-ceph: 새로운 리소스와 operator 파드가 배포됩니다.
- rook-ceph-cluster: osd, mon 등 ceph 구성이 배포됩니다.

![Untitled](/images/2022-03-06-Ceph-Cluster-install-with-helm/Untitled%203.png)

### rook-ceph 구성

아래 명령어를 실행하여 rook-ceph chart를 다운받습니다.

```bash
$ helm pull rook/rook-ceph --untar
```

helm 구조와 동일하며 values.yaml를 확인합니다.

### values.yaml 확인

변경할 부분이 있을때 수정하면됩니다. 저는 기본값으로 진행합니다.

### rook-ceph chart 배포

기본적으로 rook-ceph 네임스페이스에 배포를 해야합니다. 

뒤에서 진행할 rook-ceph-cluster chart에선 rook-ceph가 기본값입니다.

```bash
$ helm install --create-namespace --namespace rook-ceph .
```

### 오퍼레이터 확인

status가 running인지 확인합니다. 약 3분이내에 running 됩니다.

```bash
(base) joonwookim@Joonwooui-MacBookPro ~ % kubectl --namespace rook-ceph get pods -l "app=rook-ceph-operator"
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
rook-ceph-operator-7bc8964f4d-4ttgh   1/1     Running   0          19s
```

### rook-ceph-cluster 다운

아래 명령어를 실행하여 chart를 다운받습니다.

```bash
helm pull rook-ceph-cluster --untar
```

### value.yaml 확인

개인적인 환경구성으로 변경하시면 됩니다. 노드가 3개라면 기본값으로 진행해도 됩니다.

toolbox enable true로 변경하였습니다. 

region을 ap-northeast-2으로 변경하였습니다.

### ceph cluster 확인

아래 명령어를 실행하여 pod 상태를 확인합니다.

```bash
kubectl -n rook-ceph get pod
```

모든 파드가 running이 되었고, osd 파드도 3개 생긴걸 알 수있습니다. 환경에 따라 갯수를 달라질 수 있습니다.

```

### storageClass 확인

기본적으로 block, filesystem, object 를 제공하고 있습니다. storageclass 를 확인해봅니다. 

![Untitled](/images/2022-03-06-Ceph-Cluster-install-with-helm/Untitled%205.png)

### PVC 생성

ceph-block 으로 pvc를 생성해봅니다.

pvc.yaml 내용

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: example-pvc
spec:
  storageClassName: ceph-block
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

pvc.yaml 배포와 PVC 생성이 되며 PVC 상태도 bound으로 잘나오는걸 확인 할 수 있습니다.

## 마무리

ceph는 쿠버네티스 스토리지영역에서 많이 호환이 됩니다. rook 을 통해 ceph를 쉽게 클러스터를 구성을 도와줍니다. 추가로 helm을 사용하면 좀더 편하게 구성할 수가 있었습니다.
